# Gender and Age Classification Using Machine Learning 🧓👩‍🦱

A deep learning project that predicts gender and age from facial images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Built using the UTKFace dataset and trained in Google Colab.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This project is designed to:
- Classify gender (Male / Female)
- Predict age (as a regression task)

It uses a **multi-output CNN model** with shared convolutional layers and two separate output branches for gender and age.

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- UTKFace Dataset (from Kaggle)

---

## 🖼️ Dataset

**UTKFace**: A large-scale facial dataset with images labeled by age, gender, and ethnicity.

- ~20,000 images
- Age labels: 0–116 years
- Gender: 0 = Male, 1 = Female

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

- 3 Convolutional layers with BatchNormalization and MaxPooling
- Dense layers with Dropout
- Two output heads:
  - `gender_output`: sigmoid for binary classification
  - `age_output`: linear for age regression

---

## 📊 Results

- **Gender Accuracy**: ~58% (can be improved with tuning)
- **Age MAE**: ~13 years
- **Tested with real-life images** — including fun predictions on family members 👵👴

---

## 🧪 Future Improvements

- Improve accuracy with class balancing & deeper architecture
- Use face detection (OpenCV) before prediction
- Add age-group classification instead of full regression

---

## 📦 How to Use

```python
# Load model
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model("gender_age_model.h5")

# Preprocess image and predict
# (refer to notebook for function)
